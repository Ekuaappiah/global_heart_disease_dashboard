# Global-Heart-Disease-Visualisation-Project_Team1

This web-based interactive dashboard provides data visualizations and insights for exploring and analyzing global health and demographic data. Users can interact with various charts to understand trends in mortality rates, prevalence rates, and risk factors across countries and regions over time.

## Features

The dashboard contains 4 pages which different features

Overview Page

  Key Metrics & Insights
- Total Countries Analyzed: Displays the number of countries and territories with heart disease data.
  Most Recent Year of Data: Shows the latest year for which data is available.
- Average Mortality Rate: Presents the average heart disease mortality rate (per 100,000 people).
- Average Prevalence Rate: Displays the average heart disease prevalence rate (per 100,000 people).
- Top 8 Countries by Metric: View the top 8 countries based on selected metrics such as Prevalence Rate, - **Mortality Rate, and Incidence Rate. Allows filtering by year for more granular analysis.
- Global GDP & Health Expenditure Trend: Visualize trends for GDP and health expenditure as a percentage of GDP over time.
- Life Expectancy & Health Expenditure Trends: Compare trends in life expectancy and health expenditure (% of GDP) over time.
- Risk Factor Analysis
- Global Risk Factors (Latest Year): Displays key risk factors such as Obesity Prevalence Rate, Physical Activity Rate, Alcohol Consumption, and Diabetes Prevalence Rate for the most recent year.
  Health Expenditure & Risk Factor Trends: Explore correlations between health expenditure and major risk factors, like obesity and physical inactivity, across different countries.
- Data Sources: A comprehensive list of authoritative global health and economic databases used in the analysis, including sources like WHO Global Health Observatory, World Bank, and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study.

Global Health Maps
